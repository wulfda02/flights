# flights

flightLibrary.py contains all of the definitions and special numbers
for self-contained processing of flight data. Inputs are the cardfiles 
in long-endian, int16 format (i.e. the output of cardfile.f)

For k8r61, also provide fil.fits files for making optimum filters.
(j5r62 and h6r19 make filters from the data)

For j5r62 and h6r19, also provide swp.fits files for timing.
(k8r61 uses bias offs)

(2013 Flight = 36.294 = k8r61)
(2011 Flight = 36.264 = j5r62)
(2008 Flight = 36.223 = h6r19)
